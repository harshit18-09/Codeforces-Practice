# Codeforces Practice ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces problems, organized by difficulty level and contests. I'm solving these problems to improve my Data Structures & Algorithms skills and prepare for coding interviews and contests.

## ðŸš§ Languages Used
- ðŸŸ¦ C++ (Primary)
- ðŸŸ¨ Python (Occasionally)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Improve competitive problem-solving skills
- Build speed and accuracy for contests (Codeforces, CodeChef, etc.)
- Maintain clean, readable code and structured GitHub history
